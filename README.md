# Todo sample
This is just a simple todo application to get familiar with go and 
what is htmx.

## What it does ?
Just a simple crud with a database connection (only my localhost).

You just can:
- Create a task
- Marks it as done
- Delete task
- And update its name

## What I learned ?
- Go is a really fun language.
- Structs over objects (in a go way)
- How do interfaces works
- Defer? what the f...
- Pointer, pointers and more pointers
- Main doesn't need to be in root, gosh
- For is the best iterative loop (I mean it's the only iterative loop in go)
- Parentheses?? what the fuck is that ?
- You don't need something like express to have a nice and simple api
- HTMX is goat (I don't like frontend at all)
